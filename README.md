# Resumo
A small notebook made in Node Js with the Electron framework.

# Funções
The app saves a file by encrypting its text, preventing other people from seeing its contents.

Later, if you open the same file in the app, it will decrypt all the text that was there.

# Dependências
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/pt/) - builds the desktop application.
- [Quill](https://quilljs.com) - text editor
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org) - good things on the code
